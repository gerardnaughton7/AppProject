# AppProject
Project for Mobile applications development
This is a simple to do list app for android for my college project for 2nd year computer prgramming and software development.
i created a app with 3 tabs a about tab, addtask tab and tasks tab
about tab contains information on how to run the app
addtask tab adds the new task and date to the tasks list
tasks tab displays all the tasks on the list.
it also lets the user search for the task and delete when task is complete
i tried to add a check and uncheck button but when i added the search functionality it would work.
the check and uncheck would change the color of the task to indicate it was done.
you can see the code in commit 5 before i deleted it.
hope you enjoy the app
